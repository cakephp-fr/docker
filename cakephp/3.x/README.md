# Docker for CakePHP 3.x #

I took inspiration from the following repo:
- [eko/docker-symfony](https://github.com/eko/docker-symfony)
- [occitech/docker](https://github.com/occitech/docker)

Go to the [cakephp-fr/app README](https://github.com/cakephp-fr/app/tree/docker)
to get full documentation on how to install a CakePHP 3 application.
